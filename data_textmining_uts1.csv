Padma Hotel Semarang,Gege Ate,1.0,"Will make a two points of review: So the hotel looked beautiful, but it is a new building, so i don't think it's worth any special attention. It would be weird if it should be a new hotel but looked like an old building. So nothing special for this point. Service wise- well it's painful for me to say, but the crews worked so slow here. I lost my phone on the venue, during an event. Yes, it was a big event, a lot of people came there, but what disappointed me the most was that the hotel's crews response was so slow, and it was so painful to see how slow they reacted. I had to be persistent so they knew that I hadn't found my phone, ended up meeting the chief secretary and head of IT 4 hours since I reported my missing phone, who repeatedly told me to track myself and they would TRY to call my number on their end. Until this day, I actually didn't know if they made any effort AT ALL to find my phone. They told me they would search the employees' lockers, but to this day I don't think they ever did it. It was maybe merely an empty promise. In the end, they stopped after looking for 2 hours, the chief of security left to have dinner, and didn't try to look for it again and head of IT went home. So this one star is not given to the hotel building, but to the service I got while attending the event there. Theoretically, if my phone was taken by one of the employees, Shame on them for protecting their employees. If one of them likes to steal, it's possible for them to steal stuff from other guests as well. Why would they open a hotel only to fill it with employees who like to steal from the guests? Also, if it was taken by one of the guest, their response was so slow and not typically done when you were at a five star hotel. Shame though, I frequently stayed at Padma Ubud and their service was stellar everytime. Definitely won't come here again, better stay at another hotel with cheaper price. I choose padma ubud everytime."

Padma Hotel Semarang,Upik Anggraheni,1.0,"(Translated by Google) I've been planning to stay at Padma since last month for October 15th. I took the deluxe twin room promo with an extra bed at a price of 2.xxx.xxx for 3 people. 2 days before the check-in date, I was informed by the travel party that the deluxe twin room cannot be added with an extra bed. I confirmed to the hotel and was asked to upgrade to king deluxe but the addition process cannot be personal, it must be via travel. Meanwhile, the hotel suggests canceling the one from travel and direct message to the new one via the hotel. Because it couldn't be refunded, I finally processed it via travel by adding 1.1 million. This morning I was contacted again that the king deluxe room had run out and had to upgrade to a deluxe balcony at a price of 3.370 million. 10 minutes later, it was informed again that the price went up to 3,550 million. I was very disappointed with the reservation process. If you don't plan to give a promo from the start, then don't do it. And the reason that the deluxe twin can't be added with an extrabed also doesn't make sense considering the size of the room. It's a shame this experience had to be experienced even before our stay. And it's like they have no other choice because they have already ordered. Looks like the hotel forced itself to get a reservation with a normal hafga. Hopefully no one will be fooled by this hotel marketing game in the future. Previously I had often stayed at Padma Bandung, Legian and Ubud and was always satisfied. This is the first time I've had a really disappointing experience from a Padma class hotel. (Original) Saya sudah berencana menginap di Padma sejak sebulan lalu untuk tgl 15 Oktober. Saya ambil promo kamar twin deluxe dengan extrabed dengan harga 2.xxx.xxx untuk 3 orang. 2 hari sebelum tanggal check in, saya dikabari oleh pihak travel bahwa kamar twin deluxe tidak bisa ditambah extrabed. Saya konfirmasi ke hotel dan diminta untuk upgrade ke king deluxe tapi proses penambahan tidak bisa personal, harus via travel. Sementara pihak hotel menyarankan untuk batalkan yg dari travel dan pesen langsung yang baru via hotel. Karena ga bisa direfund, akhirnya saya proses via travel dengan menambah 1.1jt. Pagi ini saya dihubungi lagi bahwa kamar king deluxe sudah habis dan harus upgrade ke deluxe balcony dengan harga 3.370jt. 10 menit kemudian diinfo kembali harga naik 3.550 jt. Saya sangat kecewa dengan proses reservasinya. Kalau memang tidak berencana memberika promo dari awal ya ga usah. Dan alasan bahwa twin deluxe tidak bisa ditambah extrabed juga ga masuk akal mengingat besarnya kamar. Agak disayangkan pemgalaman ini harus dialami bahkan sebelum kami menginap. Dan seperti ga punya pilihan lain karena sudah terlanjur pesan. Sepertinya hotel memaksakan diri untuk mendapatkan reservasi dengan hafga senormal2nya. Mudah2an ga ada yang tertipu dengan permainan marketing hotel ini di kemudian hari. Sebelumnya saya sudah sering menginap di Padma Bandung, Legian dan Ubud dan selalu puas. Baru kali ini mendapatkan pengalaman yang sungguh mengecewakan dari sebuah hotel sekelas Padma."
Padma Hotel Semarang,Veronica Sherly,5.0,"(Translated by Google) We as a family often visit Semarang because it is my husband's hometown. So we've tried a lot of different hotels in Semarang. And in my opinion, Padma Semarang is THE BEST HOTEL IN SEMARANG FOR TIME! Much better than T*ntr*m Hotel in terms of food quality and staff friendliness. Mba Shafira at the Guest Relationship Officer is incredibly friendly. Mas Syaiful at Semawis Restaurant has excellent service, very friendly and alert. There is no doubt about the cleanliness of the rooms, the hotel is still new, right. The pastry is delicious, the cake is delicious, the macarons are delicious. The gelato is also not bad for that price. The glewo rice and pecel in breakfast are also delicious. Duhhh just totally recommended to stay here. Keep it up, Padma Semarang, I love you! See you soon!! (Original) Kami sekeluarga sangat sering berkunjung ke Semarang karena itu adalah hometown suami saya. Jadi kami sudah sangat banyak mencoba berbagai hotel di Semarang. Dan menurut saya, Padma Semarang adalah HOTEL TERBAIK DI SEMARANG UNTUK SAAT INI! Much better daripada T*ntr*m Hotel dari sisi kualitas rasa makanan dan keramahan staff nya. Mba Shafira di Guest Relationship Officer sangat luar biasa sekali ramahnya. Mas Syaiful di Semawis Restaurant sangat superb sekali servicenya, sangat ramah dan sigap. Soal kebersihan kamar tidak perlu diragukan lagi secara hotelnya masih baru juga kan. Pastry nya enak, cake nya enak, macaron nya enak. Gelato nya juga not bad lah utk ukuran harga segitu. Nasi glewo dan pecel yg di breakfast juga enak. Duhhh pokoknya totally recommended utk stay disini. Keep it up yah Padma Semarang, aku padamuuu! See you soon!!"
Padma Hotel Semarang,Ully Ginting,5.0,"(Translated by Google) There is no doubt about the quality of the Padma hotel chain. The deluxe room with balcony is really good. Free minibar. The breakfast is okay üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº apart from the cherry tomatoes which are for salad, not fresh for 2x breakfasts, also Soto Semarang which I think is too salty. Overall very tasty. Thank you to Ms. Yesi and Ms. Nefri who have served in a friendly manner üôèüèºüôèüèº. The most satisfying thing is the swimming pool... Masha Allah... the water is warm and it looks like there is salty sea water but it's not as salty as sea water (using chlorine??), how come swimming is not as tired as when you use chlorine, right? and opening your eyes in the water doesn't hurt either. I really like Padma Semarang. Keep the good work ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº (Original) Chain hotel Padma mmg mggak diragukan lg kualitasnya. Kamar deluxe with balconynya oke banget.

Yg paling memuaskan swimming poolnyaaa...MasyaAllah...airnya hangat dan kyk ada asin2 air laut tp nggak seasin air laut (pake chlorine??), berenang kok jd nggak secapek kl di rmh yg pake kaporit ya? dan buka mata dlm air juga nggak perih.

Padma Hotel Semarang,Tri Tunggal Baharialam,5.0,"(Translated by Google) 3 nights stay at Hotel Padma, services ranging from entrance security, reception, housekeeping and restaurant are quite satisfactory. The input for the parking sensor needs to be corrected because the sensor reader took a long time to verify the parking receipt barcode and the placement of the Assembly Point sign could not be read clearly because it was slightly blocked by the completeness of the hotel area exit door (front gate) (Original) 3 malam menginap di Hotel Padma pelayanan mulai dari sekuriti pintu masuk, resepsionis, housekeeping dan resto cukup memuaskan. Masukan untuk sensor parkir perlu diperbaiki karena reader sensor cukup lama memverifikasi barcode struk parkir dan penempatan tanda Assembly Point tidak dapat terbaca jelas karena sedikit terhalang oleh kelengkapan pintu keluar area hotel (front gate)"
Padma Hotel Semarang,andri aku,5.0,"(Translated by Google) That's why it's delicious.. I have to admit it.. the hotel is still new.. clean.. a tough rival to Semarang.. It's around the pool that it's still hot.. later we'll see how comfortable it will be after the plants thrive. What is still lacking, when making a lunch reservation, it is not flexible enough for guests who come first. Hotel room doors are hard to open. Laying the table of dirty dishes should not be behind the chair of the person eating. (Original) Makanya enak2.. harus diakui itu.. hotelnya masih baru.. bersih.. saingan berat tentrem semarang.. ini sekitar kolam masih panas.. nanti kita lihat seberapa nyaman setelah tanamannya tumbuh subur. Yg masih kurang, saat reservasi makan siang, kurang fleksibel saja terhadap tamu yg datang duluan. Pintu kamar hotel berat untuk dibuka. Peletakan meja piring kotor sebaiknya tdk dibelakang persis kursi orang makan."

Padma Hotel Semarang,Andi huang,5.0,"(Translated by Google) convey my frustration with housekeeping/bag. open the car door/lobby door named Mr. Hendry. Krn was clearly grumbling/grunting when he looked away from me. he doesn't deserve to be a frontliner dealing with guests but has that kind of attitude. it could boomerang for Padma in the future. I will change this rating if it is responded to. thanks. // Thank you for responding to my disappointment at that time, I don't think it needs to be extended. let it be the attention of the relevant management.

Grand Candi Hotel,Sabina KWin,1.0,I'm not going to review the room but it's about the bakery. The cake I ordered should be tiramisu cake but they made cheese cake which the taste not so good to me. Their response about this accident also very slow. Until right now they haven't take any action regarding the complaint
Grand Candi Hotel,Cung kring,4.0,it was a great hotel before. but its a bit out of dates. Foods are so so. rooms are plenty. parking is not the only problem. Swimming pool is old and a bit unclean. Staffs are very helpful. Life music in the lobby will play everyday.. the ornaments are so modern arty. Over all the hotel is nice.
Grand Candi Hotel,Desy Gita Lestari,4.0,"Despite of old hotel, this hotel is still quite good for travelers with family/kids. Room is big enough, although the towels are a bit yellowish, but overall cleanliness is still acceptable. Breakfast have lots of choices, from Indonesian, Asian & Western food."
Grand Candi Hotel,M. Farhan,2.0,"This hotel is a little bit too pricey. Five-star, they said. The room does not even have bathtub. The curtain in room 720 is grown by fungi so densely.

Grand Candi Hotel,Richard Gregory,5.0,"We stayed a week at the Grand Candi and enjoyed our entire stay. It's a little bit dated in some ways but it is well maintained and clean.

Grand Candi Hotel,Raka A. Soenarno,5.0,"The hotel is clean, big and beautiful. The lobby huge (if you love art, you'll love this hotel), the room aren't the best but not bad!

Grand Candi Hotel,Dicky Silitonga,5.0,"A fine hotel situated in a good neighborhood of candi. Artworks in the lobby just like an art gallery. Good breakfast. Staffs are nice. City or sea view from higher floors. They have swimming pool for kids and adults, gym, tennis court. There is a cash machine in front of the hotel. Parking is sometimes busy and full. Enjoyed the stay :)"
Grand Candi Hotel,Ray,5.0,Sure it is an older building but it is possibly the best hotel in Semarang. People there really make you feel at home. They will go out of their way to help you. You will appreciate and love them too. They are amazing. The food is really good and their pastry chef is amazing. It is very clean and you can feel safe and secured. There are also really nice restaurants and cafes nearby.
Grand Candi Hotel,David Villanueva,5.0,Rooms were nice. Very good Housekeeping. Breakfast buffet at par with other 5 five star hotels I've been to. Hotel staff very accommodating even if there is a bit of a language barrier they will try their best to make your stay a pleasant one.
Grand Candi Hotel,Ika Hapsari,5.0,"I haven't remembered to take any pictures in this hotel since I was really enjoying my one-night-stay on my business trip. The hotel concept is not so modern, but what makes unique things are they put some art installation and artsy paintings in their lobby area. I love their breakfast, I rarely found dimsum and sushi for in the hotel breakfast standard but they have it. Also that's a plus poin, the taste also beyond expectation. Maybe they have to put more lights bulb in the room because I think the light inside isn't sufficient/too dark"
Grand Candi Hotel,Amon Sabara,2.0,"I don't know why this hotel got a high rating.. this is an old building.. with extra prices.. be careful when you booked online.. cause this hotel provide you with a trap.. ""not include breakfast"".. then they will charge you with more extra prices for the breakfast.. I feel somehow there's a strange smell in the corner of your nose when you entered the lift, the hall and the room.. you knew it and you feel it.. but you cant do anything about it.. Some spots are Instagrammable but the services that you'll get will be a standard like any other hotels.."
Grand Candi Hotel,Febriane Trinanda,4.0,Old but maintained hotel that will give you homey feeling.. it's also well known for its Sang Yuen Chinese restaurant. The restaurant never empty until you have to make reservations in prior before you can dine in.. spacious lobby with many unique statues and paintings too bad they're dusty..
Grand Candi Hotel,Takagame Aoi,5.0,They have this concept of using artistic paintings as decorations and I personally like it. The room was comfortable and aesthetic. And the service was really great. The employees are so friendly and welcoming. Love it.
Grand Candi Hotel,Dimas Rangga W.,4.0,"I dont know why everyone is complaining the food in this hotel. The food is great! Its an old building, yes. But it have the famous Javanese hospitality.

One if the very rare hotel in the capital of Central Java having nice swimming pool, tennis court and great gym as well as spa. The rooms are recently refurbished and are quite spacy; amenities are good; room rate are interestingly competitive compare with other newer hotels. Good restaurants are available at its vicinity within walking distance."
Grand Candi Hotel,Medio Venda mario,3.0,"Not so special for me. It's pretty far from the city. The room is average. The sink had problem, which was absorbed very slow that made the shower floor become a puddle. The breakfast was ok. Swimming pool wasn't something great, small size. And during my stay, it was on maintenance. The gym was ok. The staff was superb! The aircon works fine."
Grand Candi Hotel,Aldo Widarta,5.0,"A renovate hotel , being a 5 stars for more than a decade , and still got the very good hotel image , so comfort , have a nice lounge , a tasty chinese restaurant , also a good all you can eat buffet for breakfast. Being there for several wedding and birthday party at their ballroom , is a good experience also an honour to come there. With a huge lobby , very interesting art statue at lobby , and also they got live music every weekend , so we can enjoy the lounge very well. If you go to the 10th floor , they have a very nice lounge if we want a more private and quite meeting with friends or family."
Grand Candi Hotel,dtes99,2.0,"Stayed there for a work trip. The room appeared to be clean, but I found out that it had a bug infestation on the entire 5 floor, and I had to go get two anti-inflammatory injections at the hospital to stop the rash that developed from the bug bites. The menu is 100% indonesian and I had a few issues with finding a meal that appealed to my tastebuds. No hot water, just warm. The toilet never stopped flushing, so I had to close the bathroom door to get sleep. The drinks in the lobby bar are very expensive compared to the local restaurants. I will not stay there again."

Grand Candi Hotel,Vina Meliana,3.0,The only nice thing about this hotel is the lobby. The room is out dated and the aircond in the rooms do not work properly. Hot & stuffy! The pool is in desperate need of an update. The rooftop bar does not exist! only opens on the weekend apparently. Would not recommend staying here. There are many other nicer hotels around semarang!
Grand Candi Hotel,Olivier Le Clef,4.0,Comfortable bed and clean room but bathroom needs renovation (plumbing is outdated). Also only 1 of 2 elevators functional.
Grand Candi Hotel,Unknown,5.0,"really great hotel in center city, far from cimory and far far away from bandungan area. almost 2 hours if we wanna go to ayanaz.... the hotel is cozy, i like the welcome food. breakfast with very good taste. the bed room is very comfortable with 2 views inside and very big room, mayve deluxe or executive, king koil bed size 180 wow. there is a minimarket near the grand candi hotel, and a big resto. maybe only 200 meters from hotel. the price is more expensive if you booked 1day before holiday (h-1). standart room rate only Rp400-650, but in holiday it will become Rp1,5juta-3juta per room per day"
Grand Candi Hotel,Budy Wuysang,3.0,"Executive room is rather small. Has fridge but small 32 inch LCD TV. Has 2 restaurant. Has non halal Chinese on 1st floor, which worth 8/10 for the taste. Main/breakfast restaurant is on ground floor, scored 7/10. Has executive music & karaoke night club on lower ground (basement), but really pricey. Perhaps your should try your luck with other 5S Gumaya or even 4S Louis Kienne."

Grand Candi Hotel,Krishna Wiharsa,3.0,"One of the classic and aged premium hotel in Semarang, in Candi area in the uphill just outside the city. Still well maintained but the age shows."
Grand Edge Hotel,mnr rahadi,5.0,"I like the room view with wide glass window to the city and to the hills, the affordable price, the dispenser so we don't have to throw plastic bottle, the one door for cabinet and bathroom (though it's not that fit so less privacy in the shower), the separated toilet and shower, the cafe n playground on the main floor, and the rooftop pool. But I don't like how we only have 1 key, since the lift needs key too. I can't go separately with my family. I also don't like the food. It was awful for 4 star restaurant: no refill , just ok taste, long queue for omelette, minimum choice. But for the price, this hotel is still recommended."
Grand Edge Hotel,Chrisna Angela,5.0,"Room was good and clean. Food was good too, various and they are doing the buffet for breakfast already. The price was affordable too. One thing that you should know before to chose this hotel is that they have bar or lounge or club in the building, since I was staying in the 6th floor, i heard a loud music in a distance at around after midnight that woke me up from sleep. This hotel is highly recommended for me in such a price, but if you are looking for a quiet place to stay, I can say that you need to book in a lower floor, maybe it will decrease the noise. Other than that were exquisite, I would love to come back anytime visit Semarang in that area. One thing that I almost forgot was the air conditioner was so cold, even I have been picked the lower blower and higher temperature, they still cold, idk maybe I could say too good."
Grand Edge Hotel,Thias Mayang,3.0,"(-) The room is dirty and and smelly. The bedsheets as well as the towels were full of stains. Since it's within multiple business in the building including karaokes, so we can smell cigarettes smokes especially in lift. When it comes to breakfast, actually it is quite good, but then the watermelon are sour just like it's not fresh at all, even though they staff directly change it after I complained it. (+) The positive in this hotel was the staff are helpful and really responsive."
Grand Edge Hotel,Thorsten Kimpel,2.0,"Good rooms, Good Breakfast. But on 2nd floor of the Hotel is a Club and from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. in the whole Hotel you hear the sound in this Time. From 3rd floor as an esrthquake to the 6th floor like you stay only 2 rooms Away. A Hotel for Party People for Sure, but not for guest who want to have a peaceful Stay. And absolutely not for the rate you must Pay. Absolutely no Recommendation."
Grand Edge Hotel,elva_ C,4.0,Its one of good 4 star Hotel at Semarang. Price is resanoble and it's worth every Rupiah that you pay for. This Hotel has a lot of basement parking space. Breakfast has a various food and taste good enough. At Night you can have dinner at Bleu Sky Lounge. This Place has various type of food and drink. You can sing around 8 at night and has a live music as well. If you come to Semarang you should try stay at Grand Edge Hotel. it's very recomended Hotel.
Grand Edge Hotel,Thorsten Kimpel,1.0,"Loudest hotel I ever stayed. Traffic very loud from outside, but biggest problem is the club on 2nd floor. From 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. you must accept loud bass beats, karaoke singing and some days live music. For a stay in an hotel a now go. Focus is here only on the club and the rich people joining it.

Grand Edge Hotel,Leon Kawidjaja,3.0,"This hotel has strategic location at Candi area in upper Semarang, it's not far from toll road ramp. Easy to find good food within walking distance - chicken rice, pizza, etc. Rooftop pool has great view and it's good for laps. Staff is friendly, breakfast is alright. However, the room is not so comfortable: the decor is dark and uninspiring, the windows are dirty so we cannot enjoy view from room, the separate shower and toilet booths share single door, but the toilet floods after shower is used, room AC was too cold. There's noisy music well into the evening. Perhaps ask for room furthest from elevator lobby."

For breakfast I give 4 stars, because tasteless as nothing special. But, there's many meals option. The staffs in the restaurant were a bit slow. Anyway I love the swimming pool even though I had no chance to jump in because it's raining during our stay. Bleu lounge and restaurant is very nice for relax a bit and enjoy the view and drinks. Would love to come back again for my next stay. And thank you for nice security and front desk for their warmth welcoming."

Close to city centers. Located right next two several new eateries in the city. The hotel also has a brand new bar and resto on the loft right next to its swimming pool. Breakfast : Need some improvement in its quality and variety, given the price. Overall : 8/10 good place to spend a night or two for light and business travelers."
Grand Edge Hotel,Regy Silitonga,4.0,"An expression that I can convey after my first stay at Hotel Grand Edge is a great hotel with good service from their staff. they very helpful, friendly and good communication to customer. the location is not far to center of Semarang City so it's quite strategic for us if want to hang out in Semarang City. There are several restaurant choices that are in the same building as this hotel, like : Bayleaf, Magal Korean BBQ. And if want coffee we can find it at Koffee Talk ( i've try it and good taste ). My family and I choose deluxe room when stay, that room is good but their have some improvement or maintaining because AC button is a little loose so it can't be set properly, some part in corner not clean enough. The best and cozy place in this hotel is swimming pool in roof top. for breakfast is excellent, very tasty,a lot of variant menu and good for our kids. thank you for service and hospitality for Hotel Grand Edge team, great work and keep maintain it."

At Grand Edge , we decided to stay inJunior suite. We don't mind the bright purple that dominate the hotel.But the lay out of the room is odd. There is no privacy in the bathroom. There is a crack in our window ( a big no- no). The furniture is falling apart. We could hear water leaking all through the night. We could also hear noise coming from the karoke. Breakfast is bad - not that many choices. The only good thing about breakfast is the view. The hotel is situated in the center of Semarang with lots of food options . But the hotel needs major renovation. One night is enough for us. We wouldn't be back."
Grand Edge Hotel,Kiara Paramita Octaviani,3.0,"This was a so so hotel for me. Some things I like, some I don't. Pros : nice view in rooftop pool, kids playground, kids haircut, many choices of foods stall and cafes in lower ground. Cons : receptionist could be more friendly, they only give one room key, if you want more you have to deposit some money. Breakfast is so so. I dislike the open bathroom style in my room, it has no privacy. And the housekeeping service is a lil bit slow. They forget my additional towel (I ordered an extra bed and already asked for a towel but it never came). And the extra bed itself came in cheap looking bed with thin matress. It also about 20 mins drive from central city."

Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,Ira Susana,5.0,"This was our second time staying at the hotel. The first time was like around 14 years ago, in 2007 on our road trip from Bali to Jakarta. Whereas this time, we stayed during our trip from Jakarta to Malang. We stayed only one night in Semarang and continued to Yogya the next day. Patra Hotel brought back the sweet memories for our family. The facilities, staff and management were nice as a four-star hotel should be. My children and husband went for a swim and we were the only guests in the area. Probably due to the pandemic and it was a weekday, not weekend. The resto buffet served many choices of food on the menu. They provided plastic gloves for guests to take their own food. The welcome drink was nice and refreshing. Overall, it‚Äôs recommended for a four-star hotel."

Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,Vincentine Yovita,2.0,Old building need a lot to fix!!! I stayed there for a day. But the air-conditioner was broken. Not cold at all. The room was big. But its so hot. We can't even sleep at night. The staff respond also was very slow. So bad. The only thing we enjoyed is the pool.
Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,muister norman,5.0,"This hotel is located at the very strategical place, in the middle of vital public services like Semarang police academy, ministry of religious affair's offices, Sisingamaraja post office, branch of Mandiri bank, fast-food restaurants, Korean resto, and many food stalls. This hotel also has a modern Javanese touch. You will find the symbols of Javanese cultures in some spots of the hotel, for example 'gunungan', 'wayang', etc. On the left and right side of the hotel, there are hall buildings that can accommodate hundreds of people for meetings or gatherings. Such event can also be held outdoor at their swimming pool. Last but not least, there is even a special building for cars and motorcycles parking area (eventhough the parking fee is quite expensive, 8K for my 2-hour visit). The staffs are so welcome. With the room rate around 500K/pax, it gives you comfortable experience of staying."
Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,Raditya Bagoes,5.0,"The staff were very humble, the service was great. The food also tasted good. Eventhough the hotel is a little bit old, but it's still managed well. So worth it for 500k/night."

Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,Veren Sasmita,3.0,"Took a staycation here on 14 Nov (Hotel) and 26 Des (Villa) The hotel and the villa actually pretty comfort, just need to concern more on the furniture's cleanness, especially the couch in the villa! I was overslept on the couch, and the next morning I got 8 bed bug bites, my skin became red and sooo itchy for a few days No hairdryer in the shower room, Standard breakfast, Wifi is so slow in the night, The staff's hospitality need to be improve more Overall, it's actually a nice place for an old hotel"
Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,Gautam Kumar Jha,4.0,"Good hotel except the towel seemed very old. Lot of issues with the internet connection. Breakfast is also not very sumptuous. I was told that an old Dutch time build was converted into the hotel therefore, it does not look like conventional hotel."
Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,M. Farhan,5.0,"One of the oldest yet comfortable hotels in Semarang. A relaxing place, good for you to relieve your stress.

Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,Ardyana Fahmiadi,3.0,"Smelly bathroom at first entry, although can be cleaned by room service. Old room. Breakfast was quite disappointing. Although cheaply priced, but it is hard to recommend this hotel"
Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,Ayka Pawitan Aguilar,3.0,Clean and big rooms. Breakfast buffet was limited.Staff were very strict though. They wouldn't let us borrow an umbrella when we're going on a day trip to Borobudur. Bottled water per room was limited to two (2) bottles per day only; didn't allow us any additional.
Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,Prakash Manchukonda,5.0,I have gone there for a prom night celebration.. It looked good the lighting and space are good.. It had hotel and convention halls side by side.. My taxi driver dropped me at the hotel lobby in stead of at the convention center loony.. I had to walk for one minute.. However I have no complaints about that... I. Might not have guided my driver well.. In general I give five stars for the convention hall..
Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,Anindya Drysca,5.0,Nice place to go. Good room to stay. Fast internet connection. Tasty and various breakfast. Clean swimming pool. Helpful services. Enjoyable cafe. Parking space is a lil bit far but it is okay. I had a good stay here and will be here again next time.
Patra Semarang Hotel & Convention,Faras Abyan,5.0,"Hands down, one, if not, THE best value-for-the-bucks hotel in Semarang. What you get from this hotel is a premium hotel experience even though this is a 4 star-rated hotel. The only thing keeping this from 5 star is the quality of hardwares (my AC had to be fixed before it could run properly and actually air condition the room). Other than that, class. If you're staying here, might as well upgrade to the balcony suite because the view is just great. You can enjoy the view of Semarang from the balcony accompanied by a cup of coffee. I also got the chance to experience the ballroom, which was great. It was big enough and properly air conditioned. Props to the architects for that. There's also a swimming pool, not the biggest pool in the whole world but you can fit a few families there. The service were also good. All of that with a not-so-expensive price tag, I say it's hard to overlook this one. üëå"

Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,Nurir Rohmah,4.0,"This is such a nice hotel but it's old. You can tell from its interior and exterior. Plus points They have swimming pool Quite area so it's peace and calm Service is quite nice Room is quite spacious and clean Minus points It's pretty old so if you're kind of scared person, I guess you won't vibe here. The food selection is so limited. I actually don't enjoy it. It's okay tho. The restaurant staffs were very quick tho. The area is actually not in the city center, so it's not really accessible."
Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,Heng Dju Ong,4.0,"Good value for money since they include free breakfast. Soundproof of the room however is not that good, so when neighboring hotel guests are noisy then it was very audible. Cleanliness can use a better upkeep, many small ants crawling over the beds, towels too can use better supplier."
Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,Maria Fransiska Burek Sari,4.0,"If you are looking for serenity and silence from the hustle and bustle of the city, then this is the perfect place to clear your mind. The place is not too far from the city, about 20 minutes to get to Simpang Lima. I really enjoyed the beef fried rice and the Buffet. What is a little unfortunate is that the swimming pool smells of chlorine which is very strong and the bathroom in my room leaks a little and smells of urine. But overall, the hotel is very pleasant and I will probably come back here if I visit Semarang again"

Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,tika putri,5.0,The room is comfortable and the bathroom is pretty clean. The breakfast is alright but not bad. I got a room where it overviews the residences near the hotel.

My overall experience was quite enjoyable and comfortable despite everything.

Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,SQ Basx,4.0,"Located inside the housing area. Its surounded by trees with industrial and antique design. I actually confused how i gonna put stars on this property, cause the price is so cheap when i booked last night, hence i am not expecting any 5 stars hotel facilities. It has all you need and as its surounded by trees you get good atmosphere. However the balcony is closed so even though you have trees around you you cannot open the door to the balcony and get fresh air. Common area and the room it self are lack if maintenance and cleaning, which is a shame considering its nice looking hotel and room. The toilet are bit dirty with white dirt on the shower and smelly too. The towel are soaky and looks old from the color. But again the price deal i have from one of the app last night was too good, hence I cannot complain much, but neither i can put high stars. With good maintenance and cleaning this could be good and affordable hotel to stay."

Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,Denny Arianto,3.0,The hotel is okay. Some improvement need to be made. First time entering the lobby you can smell some odour. But you can find welcome drink which is refresing and self service. The room is quite big and comfortable. They provide a cable TV as well. Bathroom need to be improved since there are dust visible in the corners. If you are lucky can get a nice view though.

Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,Hana Augustine,1.0,"We come without reservation and we choose a standart room with price of 450.000 (breakfast included). We choose this hotel because of some of the good reviews we read, we are expecting good things since this is a 4-star hotel, but when we enter the room we are disappointed. Before we enter our room, stepping out of the elevator, we see a mountain view, so we expect our room to have the same view. The hotel is very poor in service (they did not disinfected the room unless you ask), the room is shady, with only 2 small blurred cornered-windows, the towels are smelly, yellowish, and there are obvious stains and even nose hair on one of the towels (!). I immediately regret choosing this hotel, is this really the kind of 4-star hotel service ? I havent tried the breakfast yet, but i can guarantee the same disappointment as the room.. if you come from jakarta, i suggest staying in 2 star hotels at the center of the town, with good budget and better service than this one.."

Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,Faiz Chandra Ardian,4.0,"I got a really low price for room with breakfast. The staff is friendly and helpful. The room (Room L01) is spacious, clean, and cozy. However, the breakfast is so so. Just like 3-star hotel. Limited variation of food and standard taste (not bad tho). And I found a lot of uncleaned glasses in supposedly clean glasses tray. But, again, it's really cheap. What can I expect? Really worth the money."
Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,Esther Octavia,5.0,"Good hotel good service good room. Great breakfast great view great location. It is not far away from the city center. You can enjoy the scenery. The property is very nice. Some made from woods. Kinda refreshing. Burmt the breakfast location is located far away from the room. So the elders should use the car or the wheelchair to get in to the breakfast room. The hotel is clean but some of the ceiling isn't very nice. The room is big it can be used for 4 people actually. At the lobby you will be offered a welcome drink, forgot the name but kinda refreshing. Recommended for family holidays. 5/5 :)"
Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,Jeremy Siregar,1.0,"My bed was infested with ants, the bathroom smelled aweful, breakfast was sub par, you can hear everything happening outside your door (aka children screaming ruining your sleep), AC took a while to get cold, housekeeping is so understaffed to the point where they can't even help with steaming my suit. Staff were cold and unhelpful. All this while I got the most expensive room. Overall just a poor experience. Would never come back again."
Oak Tree Emerald Semarang,Ruri Fitriyanti,3.0,"The room size (deluxe) is big, but not too spacious since it's full with cupboard and shelves. It helps us to arrange our staff but yeah they take some room spaces. The staff are friendly and helpful. I found some problems in the room, like the blinked bathroom's lamp and no hand towel. Also when I took a shower, the water heater wasn't that hot. But they immediately helped us after we told them the problems. The tea and coffee box is made from wood and it looks luxurious. They also pack the toiletries elegantly. The balcony size is small, but it's enough for me to get a space to smoke. You have to ask the balcony key to the receptionist. Since it is a resort, I expected proper breakfast, but I got very disappointed of it. Because I stayed on Fasting Month, the food wasn't vary enough. Not their usual standard as I know (because I asked them about it). The taste of the food was quite good actually, but they were cold since the staff didn't heat the food enough. I told the staff immediately and they accepted my complaints quite well. They also tried to explain when I asked some questions about it. I also expected some cozy space at the hotel (like I saw on photos), but unfortunately, the cozy space is not that cozy anymore. It was dirty and only has 2 stools. They also have shuttle service. But since I didn't use that service, I cannot give my review on it. So, these are all my reasons why I gave them only 3 stars above. I hope this review will help others to decide üòä"
